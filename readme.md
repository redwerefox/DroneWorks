# DroneWorks

## A open-source addon for VRChat

DroneWorks is a framework for creating drone-based games and experiences in VRChat, by *EXTENDING* the current drone features.
The framework is applied to the World SDK, in a selected area.
Drones who enter this area will be enhanced by the framework in a customizable way.
With a opensource framework, we can create a variety of addon functionality to the drones, enabling developers and world creators.

## Design 

DroneWorks should be perceived as enhancing layer on top of the current drone functionality.
We are aiming to create features which do neither:
- interfere with the most current drone functionality
Nor
- are disruptive to other VRChat components or creations.


## Features

- DroneWorks.Core - Drone detection and common functionality
- DroneWorks.UI - Extension of the VRChat View with dynamic UI elements
- DroneWorks.Tools - Helpful scripting
- DroneWorks.Fight - Drone combat system with targetdetection, weapontypes and combat logic
- DroneWorks.Customize - Drone customization system with a variety of parts and colors
- DroneWorks.Examples - Demonstration of use
- DroneWorks.Test - Test scenes and scripting for quaility ensurance

## Current Roadmap
-[ ] Demonstation of foundational fight extension
-[ ] Demonstration of foundational customization
-[ ] Setup for VRChat Creator Companion module
-[ ] Crafting a community discord for development and social events

## Contributing
We are open to contributions and suggestions for the framework. As experienced developer you might use regular github procedures. If you are new to development, we are happy to help you get started. Join our discord for guidance if you want to contribute.
